The Login Bruteforcer is a Python-based security testing tool designed to automate the process of attempting multiple username and password combinations against a target login system. 
It can work with either a single username or a list of usernames from a file, as well as a password list. The script systematically tests each combination to identify valid credentials, helping penetration testers assess the strength of authentication mechanisms. 
It’s intended for authorized security testing only and should never be used without explicit permission from the system owner.
