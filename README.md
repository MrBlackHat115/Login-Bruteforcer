The Login Bruteforcer is a Python-based security testing tool designed to automate the process of attempting multiple username and password combinations against a target login system. 
It can work with either a single username or a list of usernames from a file, as well as a password list. The script systematically tests each combination to identify valid credentials, helping penetration testers assess the strength of authentication mechanisms. 
Itâ€™s intended for authorized security testing only and should never be used without explicit permission from the system owner.
